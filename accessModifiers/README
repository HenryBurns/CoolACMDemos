This demo isn't really complicated, but I think it's fun.

Run1
--------------------

First, ask what will happen. Will the program compile? (Why/why not).


Compile the program without the #include "header.h". Show that it is indeed a
compilation error when we try to access a private variable

Ask if anything can change when I include header.h.


Run2
--------------------

Include header.h, and ask people why it compiles, and what it's gonna do.
Then run it and show that you can redifine certain c++ keywords.

(access modifiers and true/false)
